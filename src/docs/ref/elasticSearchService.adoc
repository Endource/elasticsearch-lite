### Customization

`ElasticSearchService` leverages on `ElasticSearchMarshaller` instances to prepare and build the index, search and delete requests. Therefore it is possible to customize the requests per domain type by overriding `ElasticSearchMarshaller` methods (`preapreIndex`, `buildIndex`, ...) or globally by extending and registering the `elasticSearchService` bean.

An example of this would be if one needed to set up a parent child relationship between documents. Please refer to <<elasticSearchMarshaller, ElasticSearchMarshaller>> documentation.
